pub static HELP_TEXT: &str = r#"Foxes have infiltrated your chicken coop!
They have disguised themselves as chickens, and are trying to blend in.
Fortunately you know every little quirk of your chickens and the foxes don't.
By RIGHT CLICKING a chicken you can bring up a menu that shows all of its quirks.
If you find a chicken that is not aut-HEN-tic, you can LEFT CLICK it to kill it.
But be careful, if you kill too many chickens, you will lose the game. If you kill all the foxes, you win the game.
And as long as there is at least one fox alive, chickens will sometimes die under mysterious circumstances.
Good luck!"#;
